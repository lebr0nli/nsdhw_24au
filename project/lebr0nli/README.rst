py-rbush: Porting rbush to Python
============================

Basic Information
=================

Github repository: `lebr0nli/py-rbush <https://github.com/lebr0nli/py-rbush>`_

R-Tree structures are widely used for spatial indexing, enabling fast searches in multi-dimensional space.
There's already a `parietal-io/py-rbush <https://github.com/parietal-io/py-rbush>`_ which is a Python port of the popular JavaScript library `mourner/rbush <https://github.com/mourner/rbush>`_, designed for 2D spatial indexing of points and rectangles.
However, the Python version, `py-rbush`, is an outdated and dead project, with its last commit made over six years ago.
This project seeks to rewrite `py-rbush` from the ground up, aiming to bring the performance and capabilities of the original `rbush` to Python, while taking advantage of Python-specific optimizations.
Also I will add some missing features of the current `py-rbush` from the `rbush`.

Problem to Solve
====================

Although `numpy` is used in `py-rbush`, I believe there are areas where performance can still be improved.
The primary focus of this project will be:

1. Rewriting the core algorithms to enhance performance while maintaining the simplicity of use.

2. `py-rbush` didn't implement all the features of the original `rbush`, so I will add those missing features.

Prospective Users
=================
The updated version of `py-rbush` will be valuable for developers and researchers in fields that require fast, scalable spatial indexing, such as:

* Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
* Computer Vision and Image Processing
* Game Development
* Computational Geometry

System Architecture
===================

`py-rbush` will consist of two main components:

1. **C++ Backend:** The core R-Tree implementation will be written in C++ for performance reasons. This will be wrapped using `pybind11` to provide a Python interface.
2. **Python Frontend:** The Python frontend will provide a user-friendly API for interacting with the R-Tree. This will include methods for inserting, deleting, and querying spatial data.

API Description
===============

The library will follow the design and functionality of the original `prbush`. The core API will include:

1. **Creating a Tree**

   .. code-block:: python

      tree = RBushPlus(max_entries=9)

   An optional `max_entries` parameter defines the maximum number of entries in each tree node. A value of `9` is used by default, but this can be adjusted based on performance needs.

2. **Adding Data**

   Insert an item:

   .. code-block:: python

      item = {
          'minX': 20,
          'minY': 40,
          'maxX': 30,
          'maxY': 50,
          'data': 'example'
      }
      tree.insert(item)

3. **Removing Data**

   Remove a previously inserted item:

   .. code-block:: python

      tree.remove(item)

   If a custom comparison is needed (e.g., comparing by specific fields), a function can be provided:

   .. code-block:: python

      tree.remove(item_copy, lambda a, b: a['id'] == b['id'])

   Remove all items:

   .. code-block:: python

      tree.clear()

4. **Data Format**

   By default, items are expected to have `minX`, `minY`, `maxX`, and `maxY` properties. This format can be customized by overriding methods:

   .. code-block:: python

      class MyRBushPlus(RBushPlus):
          def to_bbox(self, item):
              return {'minX': item[0], 'minY': item[1], 'maxX': item[0], 'maxY': item[1]}
          def compare_min_x(self, a, b):
              return a[0] - b[0]
          def compare_min_y(self, a, b):
              return a[1] - b[1]

5. **Bulk-Inserting Data**

   Bulk-insert data into the tree:

   .. code-block:: python

      tree.load([item1, item2, ...])

   Bulk insertion improves performance compared to inserting items individually, especially for clustered data.

6. **Search**

   Search for items within a given bounding box:

   .. code-block:: python

      result = tree.search({
          'minX': 40,
          'minY': 20,
          'maxX': 80,
          'maxY': 70
      })

   Returns items that intersect the specified bounding box.

7. **Collisions**

   Check if any items intersect the given bounding box:

   .. code-block:: python

      result = tree.collides({
          'minX': 40,
          'minY': 20,
          'maxX': 80,
          'maxY': 70
      })

   Returns `True` if there are any intersecting items, otherwise `False`.

8. **Export and Import**

   Export the tree data as JSON:

   .. code-block:: python

      tree_data = tree.to_json()

   Import data from a previously exported JSON:

   .. code-block:: python

      tree = RBushPlus.from_json(tree_data)

   Ensure that the `max_entries` parameter is consistent between export and import operations.

Engineering Infrastructure
==========================
- **Version Control:** The project will be open-source and hosted on GitHub.
- **Build System:** The build will be fully automated using `setuptools`.
- **Testing:** Unit tests will be provided using `pytest` to ensure correctness and performance benchmarks.
- **Documentation:** Full documentation will be available with usage examples and detailed API references.

Schedule
========
1. **Week 1-2:** Research and analysis of `rbush` and `py-rbush`.
2. **Week 3-4:** Prototype core R-Tree structure and implement insertion, deletion, and search functionality.
3. **Week 5-6:** Add support for dynamic updates and optimize performance.
4. **Week 7:** Write tests, finalize documentation, and benchmark performance.
5. **Week 8:** Final review and presentation.
